Okay, enough with the acronyms. The project delves into hard things: racism, maternal morbidity and mortality, gynecological cancer. Beginning summer 2021, working with a group of creative undergraduate students, we set out to review the literature on racial disparities reported in the top Ob/Gyn journals from 2010-2021. We are creating data art based on the literature review. This repo houses code we used in the process of the project, including: conducting the PubMed search, assigning screeners and reviewers, wrangling the data collected, and creating data art.
