Okay, enough with the acronyms. The project delves into hard things: racism, maternal morbidity and mortality, gynecological cancer. Beginning summer 2021, working with a group of creative undergraduate students, we set out to review the literature on racial disparities reported in the top Ob/Gyn journals from 2010-2021. We are creating data art based on the literature review. This repo houses code we used in the process of the project, including: [conducting the PubMed search](https://github.com/katcorr/this-art-is-HARD/blob/main/Screening/search_PubMed_for_articles.R), assigning [screeners](https://github.com/katcorr/this-art-is-HARD/blob/main/Screening/assigning_screeners.R) and [reviewers](https://github.com/katcorr/this-art-is-HARD/blob/main/Reviewing/assigning_review_2021-06-24.R), [wrangling the data collected](https://github.com/katcorr/this-art-is-HARD/blob/main/Reviewing/wrangling_review_pregcomp.R), and [creating data art](https://github.com/katcorr/this-art-is-HARD/tree/main/Data_Art).
